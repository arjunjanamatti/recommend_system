A well developed recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

The recommendation system, I have designed below is based on the journey of a new customer from the time he/she lands on the business’s website for the first time to when he/she makes repeat purchases.

The recommendation system is designed in 3 parts based on the business context:

Recommendation system part I: Product pupularity based system targetted at new customers

Recommendation system part II: Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought items similar items

Recommendation system part III: When a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time withou any product rating

When a new customer without any previous purchase history visits the e-commerce website for the first time, he/she is recommended the most popular products sold on the company's website. Once, he/she makes a purchase, the recommendation system updates and recommends other products based on the purchase history and ratings provided by other users on the website. The latter part is done using collaborative filtering techniques.


Recommendation System - Part II¶
Model-based collaborative filtering system

Recommend items to users based on purchase history and similarity of ratings provided by other users who bought items to that of a particular customer.

A model based collaborative filtering technique is closen here as it helps in making predictinfg products for a particular user by identifying patterns based on preferences from multiple user data.
Utility Matrix based on products sold and user reviews

Utility Matrix

An utlity matrix is consists of all possible user-item preferences (ratings) details represented as a matrix. The utility matrix is sparce as none of the users would buy all teh items in the list, hence, most of the values are unknown.
